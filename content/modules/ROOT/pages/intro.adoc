# ACCELERATE APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT LAB GUIDE
# Red Hat Summit 2024

## INTRODUCTION
I think we can all agree that fast, secure, and continuous deployment of great software is the backbone to this generation's most successful organizations. Without a great digital experience that is constantly improving, a company risks being quickly outpaced by competitors and ultimately, obsolescence.

Modern application development is an approach that enables your development team(s) to quickly respond to business needs and improve reaction to changes by rapidly updating applications and services. They are designed and packaged as microservices that are loosely coupled for easier maintenance with higher fault tolerances. Combining this with the power of a cloud-native environment, you can speed up your build and release cycles, with less operational overhead. 

People often hesitate out of intimidation of difficult technology adoptions. This demo shows the new way of application development that can change the way an organization works, increasing each technical team's agility, relieving them from the life of repeatedly putting out fires.

The lab presents a journey through the new cloud native application development, from code to production, from writing code and operating workload, to system design.
